    * Problem :
    * Given a string , identify if it is a permutation of a palindrome
    */

  /**
    * Solution :
    * If the string contains even number of characters, then we can create an array/hashmap to make sure that every char occurs even number of times
    * , else it would not be a permutation of palindrme
    * If the string contains odd number of characters, then we can create an array/hashmap to make sure that every char occurs even number of times
    * , and only one char occurs odd number of times
